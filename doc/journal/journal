Very busy week, not much time to work on Quizzard.
Refactored some of the code I wrote last time and added comments.
Most of it will still probably be rewritten in the future, but it's a start.
Completed a basic account creation function which can be used to add students.

2016-10-06:
Extracted the database connection to its own file.
Added questions.js file which will facilitate interaction with the questions
collection in the database.
Started work on an addQuestion function to insert questions into the database.

2016-10-11:
Create a temporary question addition form which adds a question to the database.

2016-10-13:
Started work on the home page proper.
Created a question selector module which fetches questions from the database,
sorted by a given criterion.
Created the main body of the home page, consisting of two sections: the
question list and the sidebar.
Populated the question list with questions from the database, displaying basic
information about them.
Added user's name and points total to sidebar display.
Gave each question its question ID as its HTML ID, allowing the clicked question
to be easily detected.

2016-10-14:
Added a sort button above the question list with a basic dropdown menu.
Updated the question selector to allow sorting by topic or by point count.
Moved the question list into a separate template file, allowing it to be
re-rendered with new information without having to re-render the whole page.
Implemented question list sorting through an AJAX request to the server to
render a new question list with a given sort criterion.
