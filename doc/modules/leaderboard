`leaderboard` module
server/leaderboard.js


Description:

The leaderboard module maintains the list of students displayed on the
Quizzard's leaderboards.


API:

leaderboard.leaderboard(userid, shrt, callback)

Sorts students in database by decreasing points and assigns ranks to them.
Calls the function `callback` with the resulting leaderboard student list.
Arguments:
    userid - ID of the user to create leaderboard around (with `shrt`)
    shrt - if true, create a leaderboard list with at most eight entries,
           showing the top 3 user and the users around `userid`.
    callback - function to call with the resulting list.
With `shrt`, if `userid` is in the top six users, the list will contain the top
seven followed by a blank entry ({ rank: 0}), indicating a '...' in the table.
If `userid` is in the bottom four users, the list will contain the top three,
a blank entry and then the bottom four.
Otherwise, if `userid` is somewhere in the middle, the list will contain the top
three, a blank entry, the user before `userid`, `userid`, the user after
`userid` and finally a blank entry.
